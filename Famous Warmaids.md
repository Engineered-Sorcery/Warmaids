Allegiances: Unaffiliated/"Repentant"

Battle-Milk Qualities: 
Toxic Princess - "End of Days": Cynthia's battle-milk has a toxicity of simply "one part", allowing her to serve as an exceedingly potent area-denial tool. This toxicity has been known to even affect warmaids, though when properly equipped and supported warmaids can at least enter denial zones for short periods after a period of time.
