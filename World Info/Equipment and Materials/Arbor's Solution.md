First synthesized in the early days of Project Milkmaid by Dr. Ericka Arbor, Arbor's Solution is a polar liquid which serves to neutralize [[Battle Milk]]. The solution, a mixture of distilled water, chemical agents, and a proprietary enzymatic active agent can reduce or fully prevent the catalytic corrosive volatile compounds within battle-milk from acting on matter that it comes in contact with. The amount of Arbor's Solution required, and its serum concentration, varies depending on the specific qualities of the Warmaid in question, but can be roughly categorized as such:

Grade 1: 10-1 ratio of battle-milk to 10% concentrated Arbor's Solution
Grade 2: 5-1 ratio of battle-milk to 20% concentrated Arbor's Solution
Grade 3: 1-1 ratio of battle-milk to 50% concentrated Arbor's Solution
Grade 4: 1-20 ratio of battle-milk to 75+% concentrated Arbor's Solution
Grade 5: Dosage unknown
