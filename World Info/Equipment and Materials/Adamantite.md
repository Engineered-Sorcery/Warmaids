AD-229 (and its derivatives), better known as Adamantite, is a composite alloy tempered with [[Arbor's Solution|neutralized]] [[Battle Milk|battle-milk]]. As a result of this immersion it exhibits certain unique qualities that render it an extremely valuable material for Warmaid-related constructions. Most notably, it resists the catalytic-corrosive qualities of battle-milk up to (and sometimes beyond) its rated Grade indefinitely and can resist even stronger Grades of battle-milk if only exposed for a short period of time. 

In addition to its battle-milk-resistant qualities, Adamantite inherits the abnormal weight-to-tensile-and-flexile-strength traits that render Warmaids capable of being as strong as they are, allowing it to be a valuable armour and structural material in scenarios where its cost can be justified.
